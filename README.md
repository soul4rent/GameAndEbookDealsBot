# GameAndEbookDealsBot

This is a small project conisting of basic python scripts to find game deals and book deals with keywords such as "free".
It currently contains a basic script version, and code for a slow (although working) discord bot, and is currently in
slow development.

# Prerequisistes
1) You need python version 3.6

For 2, you might need to use the pip command line. For windows, I recommend GitBash, and for linux/unix, its most likely built in.
If it isn't working, make sure that PIP is installed to the path of your command line.


IF YOU WANT TO IMPLEMENT THE DISCORD BOT:

2) You need to install discord.py and praw, usually by using PIP:

pip install discord.py
pip install praw

be sure to check your python versions. You might need to use pip3 if it initially doesn't work.

3) You need to get bot tokens from Reddit and Discord.
